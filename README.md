Check who does not follow you back!

https://patrickwokk.github.io/ig-unfollowers/

Description:
Local-only, client-side tool to compare two Instagram export HTML files (followers.html and following.html) and list who isn't following you back.

How to use:
1) Go to Instagram > Settings > Accounts Center > Your information and permissions > Download your information or use your previously saved "followers_1.html" and "following_1.html" files from Instagram.

2) Drag & drop or select the two HTML files below. Order doesn't matter; you can label them.

3) The app parses usernames, compares sets, and shows diffs. Nothing is uploaded â€” all in your browser.
